            <p><strong>Developer</strong></p>
            <p>
            Proactive in solving tech problems and learning about it.<br>
            Since I started my studies at BYU, I can create my own websites and programs in different languages by myself and solve the problems that show up during the creation process. Learned how to work as a team, set goals, and achieve them successfully. I love to learn about technology and stay updated about the world changing to develop my skills.
