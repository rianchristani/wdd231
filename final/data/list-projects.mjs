    "dialog": `The Filter Temples project was a deep dive into mastering array methods in JavaScript, particularly map, filter, reduce, and forEach. The main goal was to dynamically display a list of temples and allow users to filter them based on specific criteria such as location or alphabetical order. This hands-on exercise reinforced essential programming concepts such as iteration, data manipulation, and DOM rendering. The project also involved designing a simple, clean layout that made the filtered results visually intuitive and accessible. Overall, it was an excellent way to bridge theory and practice in real-world data handling.`

    "link": "https://rianchristani.github.io/wdd131/form.html",
    "dialog": `This project focused on building a fully functional and semantically correct HTML form with proper accessibility and UX principles. The form was designed to collect user input efficiently and securely, featuring required field indicators, real-time validation feedback, and clear error messages. I also incorporated best practices such as proper label association, logical tab order, and ARIA roles where appropriate. Beyond just technical correctness, the experience taught me how thoughtful form structure improves usability and ensures a positive interaction for all users, including those using screen readers or keyboard navigation.`

    "link": "https://rianchristani.github.io/wdd131/project/home.html",
    "dialog": `This was the very first website I built completely on my own—a professional online presence for a small painting company. I was responsible for everything from layout design to code implementation, using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript to create a multi-page site with service listings, contact info, and a gallery. It may seem simple now, but it was a major achievement at the time and taught me core web development skills like responsive layout, navigation design, and organizing content in a user-friendly way. This project gave me the confidence to keep building and improving.`

    "date": "2025-04-09",
    "link": "https://rianchristani.github.io/wdd231/chamber/",
    "dialog": `The Chamber project was built to simulate a website for a local chamber of commerce. It included sections for a business directory, events calendar, weather updates, and member benefits. One of the more complex elements was dynamically pulling and displaying data from JSON files and integrating a weather API to provide real-time updates. This project enhanced my understanding of modular code, dynamic content generation, and user experience design. It felt like a full-site experience, balancing visual appeal with functional data presentation, much like a professional client-facing website.`

    "dialog": `The Rafting Project was a creative, content-rich website designed to promote a whitewater rafting business. It featured sections for trip packages, safety information, booking options, and customer testimonials. The site was developed with a mobile-first mindset, using media queries to ensure a consistent experience across all devices. I paid special attention to layout and hierarchy, using visuals and calls to action to guide users through the site. This project not only strengthened my skills in HTML and CSS but also gave me a deeper appreciation for how content strategy and visual design work together.`

    "date": "2025-06-10",
    "link": "https://rianchristani.github.io/wdd231/index.html",
    "dialog": `This project involved building a fully responsive and interactive home page for a website that offers both visual appeal and functional navigation. The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Users can explore various sections of the site, including dynamically loaded content areas, through a navigation bar and smooth scrolling features. A key component of the project was the integration of external APIs to enrich the user experience — for example, displaying real-time weather or location-based data. The project reflects an advanced understanding of responsive design principles, interactive UI elements, and asynchronous JavaScript for data-driven features.`
